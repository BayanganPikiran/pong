This is a standard Pong game created with the Python Turtle library, assisted by the Time library.

Player 1 uses the 'w' and 'x' keys, respectively, to move up and down.  Player 2 uses the up and down arrow keys.

Upon each paddle-ball collision the speed of the ball increases.  After a player score a point, the ball returns to its default speed.
The first player to five points wins.  A textinput box will appear to declare victory and ask the user if they wish to play again.
